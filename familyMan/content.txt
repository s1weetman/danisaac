Family man:

Dan is married to his wife Lorelei and is the father to two beautiful girls Raelynn
and Rochelle.

Dan says that the hardest job in the world is to be a husband and a
father, but he would never give up that job for anything else in the world. 

Dan says he is a family man first, a man of God second, and martial artist last. When
questioned how he would regard his family over God, Dan says "Since God blessed me with
this family he has charged me to love and protect them above all". 

Extended Family

Dan is proud of his close circle of loved ones, his close friends and extended family that are part of his personal life, his spiritual life and his work.
