Family man:

Dan is married to his wife Lorelei and is the father to two beautiful girls Raelynn and Rochelle. Dan says that the hardest job in the world is to be a husband and a father but he would never give up that job for anything else in the world. Dan says that he is a family man first, a man of God second and martial artist last and when questioned how he would regard his family over God, Dan says "Since God blessed me with this family he has charged me to love and protect them above all".
