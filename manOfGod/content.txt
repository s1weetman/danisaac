Man of God

Dan Isaac believes that he has a divine mission and responsibility to bring the knowledge
about God to the world. In march 1994 due to an allergic reaction to seafood he stopped
breathing for a few minutes and was then raised back to life by a prayer in the name of
Jesus Christ by his late father Rev Solomon Isaac. He is regularly invited to churches and
other religious gatherings to speak about his spiritual beliefs, and he hosts a weekly livestream
program on Facebook.
